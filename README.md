# 👋 Hi, I'm José Miguel Carrera

Full-stack software engineer & product builder focused on turning ideas into scalable, real-world products.

I design, build, and scale web platforms end-to-end — from architecture and code to deployment and growth — with a strong emphasis on clean design, execution quality, and business impact.

---

## 🚀 What I do
- Build **scalable web products** and internal platforms
- Design **clean architectures** (monoliths done right, microservices when it makes sense)
- Lead projects from **idea → MVP → production**
- Mentor developers and students in real-world engineering practices

---

## 🧠 Tech stack
**Frontend**
- React, Next.js, Vite
- TypeScript
- Modern UI systems & design systems

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express, NestJS
- REST APIs, authentication (JWT), RBAC
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis

**DevOps & Infra**
- Docker, Docker Compose
- CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud-native deployments

---

## 🏗️ Philosophy
- Execution > ideas  
- Simple architectures scale better  
- Tech must serve **people and business**, not the other way around  
- If it can’t be maintained, it’s already broken  

---

## 📌 Current focus
- Building and scaling SaaS and internal platforms  
- Architecture, DevOps, and system design  
- Teaching and mentoring future engineers
